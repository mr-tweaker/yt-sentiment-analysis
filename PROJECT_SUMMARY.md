  - Video title display (instead of IDs)
  - Custom comment count selection
  - Real-time refresh capabilities
  - Comprehensive visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, histograms, word clouds)
  - Sample comments display with color coding
  - Export functionality (CSV downloads)

### Phase 5: Docker Containerization
